# Stochastic Deep Gaussian Processes over Graphs

This is the official implementation and results of the `DGPG` model proposed in our paper: [Stochastic Deep Gaussian Processes over Graphs, (NeurIPS 2020).](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020/hash/415e1af7ea95f89f4e375162b21ae38c-Abstract.html)

## Prerequests
our implementation is mainly based on `tensorflow 1.x` and `gpflow 1.x`:

```
python 3.x (3.7 tested)
conda install tensorflow-gpu==1.15
pip install keras==2.3.1
pip install gpflow==1.5
pip install gpuinfo
```
Besides, some basic packages like `numpy` are also needed.
It's maybe easy to wrap the codes for TF2.0 and GPflow2, but it's not tested yet.
## Specification

Source code and experiment result are both provided. Unzip two archive files before using experiment notebooks.

### Files

- <span style="color: red">`dgp_graph/`</span>: cores codes of the DGPG model.
	- <span style="color:red">`impl_parallel.py`</span>: a fast node-level computation parallelized implementation, invoked by all experiments.
	- <span style="color:blue">`my_op.py`</span>: some custom tensorflow operations used in the implementation.
	- <span style="color:grey">`impl.py`</span>: a basic loop-based implementation, easy to understand but not practical, leaving just for calibration.
- <span style="color: blue">`data/`</span>: datasets.
- `doubly_stochastic_dgp/`: codes from repository [DGP](https://github.com/ICL-SML/Doubly-Stochastic-DGP)
- `compatible/`: codes to make the DGP source codes compatible with gpflow1.5.
- `gpflow_monitor/`: monitoring tool for gpflow models, from [this repo](https://github.com/markvdw/gpflow-monitor).
- `demo_city45.ipynb`: jupyter notebooks for city45 dataset experiment.
- `experiments.zip`: jupyter notebooks for other experiments.
- `results.zip`: contains original jupyter notebooks results. (exported as HTML files for archive)
- `run_toy.sh`: shell script to run additional experiment.
- `toy_main.py`: code for additional experiment (Traditional ML methods and DGPG with linear kernel).

### Experiments
The experiments are based on python src files and demonstrated by jupyter notebooks. The source of an experiment is under directory `src/experiments.zip` and the corresponding result is exported as a static HTML file stored in the directory `results.zip`. They are organized by dataset names:

1. Synthetic Datasets
	- `demo_toy_run1.ipynb`
	- `demo_toy_run2.ipynb`
	- `demo_toy_run3.ipynb`
	- `demo_toy_run4.ipynb`
	- `demo_toy_run5.ipynb`
2. Small Datasets
	- `demo_city45.ipynb`
	- `demo_city45_linear.ipynb` (linear kernel)
	- `demo_city45_baseline.ipynb` (traditional regression methods)
	- `demo_etex.ipynb`
	- `demo_etex_linear.ipynb`
	- `demo_etex_baseline.ipynb`
	- `demo_fmri.ipynb`
	- `demo_fmri_linear.ipynb`
	- `demo_fmri_baseline.ipynb`
3. Large Datasets (traffic flow prediction)
	- LA
		- `demo_la_15min.ipynb`
		- `demo_la_30min.ipynb`
		- `demo_la_60min.ipynb`
 	- BAY
		- `demo_bay_15min.ipynb`
		- `demo_bay_30min.ipynb`
		- `demo_bay_60min.ipynb`

Just run these notebooks to get the first-hand experience. Feel free to build your own experiments using core python codes.
